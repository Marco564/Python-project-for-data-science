# Python-project-for-data-science
This is a project done with the intention lo learn on how to use python functions to manipulate data and do the ETL process.

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to perform the ETL process with the aid of several Python libraries, the purpose is mostly
to learn about data science.

## SHORT EXPLANATION
Basically there is a csv file that provides exchange rates, and there's other json file that provides market caps in
US$ billions of some companies. The data of market caps of these companies is extracted then the units of 
US$ billion are transformed into GBP and the result of that is loaded into a csv file. Another thing is that every step is
saved into a log.txt file.

## LIBRARIES USED
As I said this is project to learn how to use libraries for data science some of these are
- Pandas
- glob
- datetime
- urllib.request
